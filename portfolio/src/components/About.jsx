        Hi, I'm Nadia Iradukunda Hirwa, a Software Engineer based in Kigali, Rwanda, currently pursuing a degree in Computer and Software Engineering. I have hands-on experience in web and mobile development, data analysis, and IoT systems.<br /><br />
        I've built full-stack applications using Flutter, React, Node.js, and Django, and created interactive dashboards using Power BI and Python. My projects include smart farming platforms, air quality detectors, and expense trackers.<br /><br />
        Through programs like TekHer at kLab, STES Group, and the BRIDGE Program at Carnegie Mellon, I've developed both technical and collaborative skills. I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and always eager to learn and grow.<br /><br />
        Let's connect â€” I'm open to new challenges, projects, and collaborations!
